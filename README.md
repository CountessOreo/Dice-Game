# Dice-Game
The Dice Roller Simulator is a simple program that simulates the rolling of a pair of dice. Each time the program runs, it randomly generates two numbers between 1 and 6, representing the results of each die roll. After displaying the results, the program prompts the user to decide whether they would like to roll the dice again.
